# Surface Reconstruction from High-Res CT-scans
This repository consists code to handle reconstruction of 3D surfaces from high resolution 2D CT scan images in a memory efficient manner. The code base is equipped to handle misaligned images with multi-object scans. Further option to slice the 3D surface and analyze the contour is also provided.
